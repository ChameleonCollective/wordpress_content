During the keynote, I remember that Kevin Lynch mentioned that Adobe has been working on Flash for the iPhone without much Apple support ...

The ongoing debate over Flash on the iPhone appears to be over after Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen announced last week at the <a title="World Economic Forum" href="https://www.weforum.org/en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Economic Forum</a> that <a title="Adobe" href="https://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe</a> and <a title="Apple" href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a> are working together in an effort to bring Flash to the iPhone.

While Narayen didn't answer the question of whether Apple had strengthened its commitment to putting Flash on the iPhone he did point out that the ball was now in Adobe's court. "We have the developer kit and the onus is now on us," he said.

During the Bloomberg interview, Narayen said that Adobe plans to have over a million devices shipped by the end of the year that have Flash and he's not just talking iPhone; the company is working on the <a title="Google Android" href="https://code.google.com/android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> platform, the <a title="Windows Mobile" href="https://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows mobile</a> and the <a title="symbian" href="https://www.symbian.com/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symbian</a> platform.

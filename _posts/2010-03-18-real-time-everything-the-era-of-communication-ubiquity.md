I presented "Real-Time Everything - the Era of Communication Ubiquity" at <a title="Real-Time Everything: The Era of Communication Ubiquity" href="https://my.sxsw.com/events/event/642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SXSWi 2010</a> last week and wanted to share my deck ... I uploaded it to slideshare, not sure why I haven't uploaded all my decks there, but will slowly start doing so.

The abstract / summary described the session as: A focus universe research strategy; imagine using the entire internet as your focus group. Analyze every conversation, visualize trends, compare brands, learn insights, envisage it over time, and get real factual answers, not just amplified assumptions based on focus and control groups. Now add IPv6 to the picture, digital invasion, UGC/MGC user and machine generated content; we’re not that from the day fridges tweet about food needs, tvs’ about programs, subways and highways about traffic, clubs about nightlife, ... So now imagine adding that to the picture, a digital blueprint of society.

It covers real-time culture shifts, experience, and expectations with streaming, commerce, collaboration, customer support, and more ... tons of very interesting data points.

Feedback always welcome.

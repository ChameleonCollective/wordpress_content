At best, people have ambivalent feeling about clowns.

On one end of the spectrum, there's the relatively benign Bozo the Clown, a historic television favorite whose name implied entertaining, well-meaning buffoonery. There's also the sad beauty of the crying clown of the opera Paglicci. Then, at the other end, the worst nightmare of anyone suffering from full-blown coulrophobia -- the "scary clown."

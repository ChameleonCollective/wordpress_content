Today was a great day! I spent the whole day on a client off site on South Beach in perfect Florida weather and we got to discuss some really fascinating new approaches to their strategy while in a great outdoor atmosphere. I love being in the company of bright people!

Beyond that I had two interesting updates on previous posts to the site.

First, I was tipped off my friend, and Sapient Creative Director, Juan Morales that Deep Focus apparently knocked some sense int AMC and they turned the twitter accounts back on for most of the Mad Men characters. I haven't had this officially confirmed and I'm not sure how they're managing the accounts right now, but hopefully they've come up with an approach that keeps the fans and the management team happy.

Second, I got an email from a friend at Google who contacted me after the blog launched and sent back some nice feedback on the site. He was able to get me onto the Friend Connect beta. That mean's we're going to be able to test out Friend Connect functionality right here at "Take Me To Your Leader".

I would like to thank Ryan, Sami, and Mussie at Google! You guys made my day!!!
PS - Sorry about the late post everyone. Rob and I are going to be more conscious about posting in the morning.

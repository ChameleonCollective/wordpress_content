iAd is a mobile advertising platform developed by Apple Inc. for its iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad line of mobile devices allowing third-party developers to directly embed advertisements into their applications. Unlike other banners that open a new browser window, the iAd is a full native app. The Nissan Leaf iAd allows you to customize your car, learn about key features – including comparative miles per dollar- via an engaging, informative interface. The difference is that you don’t download it voluntarily at the app store, you only get it by clicking an iAd banner.

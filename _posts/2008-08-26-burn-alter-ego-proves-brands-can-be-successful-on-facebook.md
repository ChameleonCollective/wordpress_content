The application we developed for Coca-Cola's brand Burn just recently crossed 150,000 installs with over 85,000 users active on a monthly basis.

This app allowed users to create a customizable virtual avatar, and then "go out"- either with existing friends, or new ones. The next day, users could check their avatar's blog to see what went down the night before, and view images that showed both avatars hanging out. The end result was that, just like actually going to a club, users received a story and a shared experience with a friend the next morning. Brought to them by the makers of the night-extending Burn energy drink.

We used technology in an innovative manor as an additional method to make the application stand-out in a sea of competitors. I'm proud to say the application is a finalist in both the MIXX and OMMA awards. Please wish us luck!

My name is Freddie. I'm a recovering blog-a-holic. I'm happy to admit that I'm back on the sauce and blogging again.

If you hadn't heard: I lost my laptop and even more tragically my flight log book (<a href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/logbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen here</a>) in the back of a London cab about two weeks ago. I've only now caught up with the back log and started to re-assemble my life and you will start hearing from me again on a weekly basis.

I stumbled across a couple of brilliant interactive art pieces over the last couple of weeks (via some smart friends of mine - Damion Parsons and Colleen DeCourcy). The first one is not very digital at all - it's the ultimate "Human Interface" titled Hi. Effectively it's a guy in a box that looks like a Microsoft surface performing all the computer functions himself. Entertaining and awesome - it's a must watch and share video.

The interactive installation "I Want You To Want Me", by Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar, commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art, for their "Design and the Elastic Mind" exhibition.

I Want You To Want Me explores the search for love and self in the world of online dating. It chronicles the world's long-term relationship with romance, across all ages, genders, and sexualities, using real data collected from Internet dating sites every few hours.

The piece is presented on a 56" high-resolution touch-screen, hanging vertically on the wall, and was installed at MoMA on February 14, 2008, Valentine's Day.

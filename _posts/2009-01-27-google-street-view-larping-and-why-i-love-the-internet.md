You may remember me. I used to blog here. I can't believe it's been a week since my last post.

Today I was reminded of why I love the internet so much.Â  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Street View</a>, arguably one of the most amazing mapping innovations to ever hit my computer (or now my iPhone), has inspired over the last couple years a mildly obsessive compulsive behavior that drives people to look for odd things captures as the Google car drives by with it's omni-prescent lens.

Recently it caught <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LARP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two live action roll players</a> (LARP'ers) engaged in a harrowing battle for domination of the remote control for that evenings Lord of the Rings marathon.

If you don't believe this is real then I insist you <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=8+Sampsonia+Way,+Pittsburgh,+Allegheny,+Pennsylvania+15212&amp;sll=40.462883,-80.007505&amp;sspn=0.000392,0.022745&amp;gl=us&amp;g=8+Sampsonia+Way,+Pittsburgh,+Allegheny,+Pennsylvania+15212&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.457691,-80.007505&amp;spn=0.010008,0.022745&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.457662,-80.007541&amp;panoid=KD0g-IcPQW09qFcP2RU2kg&amp;cbp=12,320.39452999338647,,0,23.034326806908396">click the link</a> and check it out for yourself. Make sure to switch on streetview and look around if it doesn't take you there directly.

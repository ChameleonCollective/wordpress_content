Looking back at the <a title="Facebook Places Official Video at TakeMeToYourLeader" href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/2010/08/19/official-facebook-places-video/" target="_self">Facebook Places official video</a>, the most compelling selling point is that Facebook helps you digitalize your memories.

Imagine if you were in Hawaii for your honeymoon, taking a cruise to all the different islands ... now imagine if each photo had a geo-tag, and a time stamp, and you could comment and add your thoughts and feelings ... Facebook places would be the platform to help you re-live this experience, follow your path or trace ... but also, what if you come back 5 years from now, to the same place ... how nice would it be to match it to your previous experiences? Or how about you go to Disney parks, and you need advice on the rides for your new kids ... you can see comments your friends made in previous experiences, recommendations, reviews ... ditto for restaurants ... you get the point.

Facebook hasn't made it official, but while I was lecturing last night at the Miami Ad School, I checked in, later on visited the place page, and I noticed that there's a section titled "<a title="Facebook Places Photo Memories" href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Facebook-Places-Photo-Memories.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photo Memories</a>".

Geo-tagging rich content is a huge differentiator against the currently actively vocal by desperation Dennis Crowley, Foursquare's CEO. Let the memories begin.

<a href="https://search.twitter.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1027 alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Twitter" src="https://takemetoyourleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/twitter-logo-small1.png" alt="Twitter" width="188" height="70" />Twitter Search</a> is going to get a lot more interesting soon, said Twitter's new vice president of operations, Santosh Jayaram, who until recently was VP of Search Quality for Google. Jayaram confirmed that Twitter Search, which currently searches only the text of Twitter posts, will soon begin to crawl the links included in tweets and begin to index the content of those pages.

This will make Twitter Search a much more complete index of what's happening in real time on the Web and make it an even more credible competitor to Google Search for people looking for very timely content.

Twitter Search will also get a "reputation" ranking system soon, Jayaram told me. When you do a search on a "trending" topic--a topic that is so big it gets its own link in the Twitter.com sidebar--Twitter will take into account the reputation of the person who wrote each tweet and rank the search results in part based on that.

Jayaram did not say precisely how reputation would be calculated; he indicated that engineers are still figuring that out. But this, again, will make Twitter Search more valuable.

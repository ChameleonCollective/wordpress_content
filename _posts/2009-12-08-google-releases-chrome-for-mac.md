<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1109" title="google chrome" src="https://takemetoyourleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/google_chrome.jpg" alt="google chrome" width="300" height="345" />After playing with Chrome developer edition for the Mac for a few weeks, <a title="Google Chrome Mac OSX" href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google released today the official Beta</a>. I tried it on a PC a few months ago and quite honestly, was not impressed at all, and haven't paid much attention since. Today I decided to run a few tests, and it seems to be 1) pretty fast, and 2) extensible?

1) Open https://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/canopy/ and click launch experiment ... tried it with Firefox 3.5, Safari 4, and Chrome 4 beta ... Chrome wins by far .... granted, this code was built to showcase Chrome specific advantages and should not reflect Safari generic JavaScript performance, but it's pretty sweet.

2) Chrome Extensions : https://chrome.google.com/extensions ... wow, I had no idea this existed... this is the main reason I like Firefox, all the nice tools ...

All n' all, I still use Safari as my main browser, Firefox to look behind the scenes, dev tools, and now I'll try Chrome a little more too.

P.S. Posting this entry using Chrome to test wordpress compatibility; thus far, all good.

[update] P.S.2 Extensions does not seem to work for Mac. Hopefully they'll enable them soon

[update] P.S.3 <a title="Enable Extensions for Google Chrome for Mac" href="https://thenextweb.com/appetite/2009/12/08/chrome-extensions-working-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enable extensions for Mac</a> through this little hack-around

I spent the whole of last week and the early part of this weekend worrying about Hurricane Ike (that is now unfortunately ravaging Cuba). I was absolutely convinced it was going to hit us and kept claiming "I have a bad feeling about this" like I was in some B horror movie.

I ended up putting up all the solid aluminum storm shutters on my house and going and shopping for supplies in case we were out of power for a week like we were a couple of years ago. I had even developed a plan to ride the storm out at the Sapient Hollywood office because it's built like a bomb shelter.

The saddest part was that I had developed this crazy plan that I was going to report the entire storm via twitter including sending photos from out of the windows (as the office has very highly rated impact glass). I thought this was going to be an amazing experience to share with the world and I actually started to look forward to it.

I'm thrilled to say the storm won't be hitting us and simultaneously embarrassed to say that I think I actually felt a moment where I was disappointed because I couldn't try out this experiment.

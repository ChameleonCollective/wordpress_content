A friend tipped me off to this great post on Josh Spear's blog on "<a title="Cat Cafes" href="https://www.vimeo.com/1141782?pg=embed&amp;sec=1141782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat Cafes</a>" in Tokyo, Japan. Essentially you can go to to a cafe and rent a cat to play with for an hour. As Josh points out - this is really indicative of how unique their fast paced culture is. Althought I don't see this as outside the realm of possability in a major cities like New York or London.

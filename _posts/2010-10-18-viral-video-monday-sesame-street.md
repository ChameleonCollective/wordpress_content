I meant to post this Friday, so let's change my <a title="Viral Video Fridays" href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/category/viral/" target="_self">Viral Video Fridays series</a> just for once.

Love the fact that it ends with I'm on a horse, cow... mainly because I found this awesome Axe billboard today that makes fun of the same line.

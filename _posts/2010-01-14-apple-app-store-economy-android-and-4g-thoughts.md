So I'm an iPhone user, and so are most of my friends ... but I really think the new gold mine is Android; I was playing with the HTC Hero and Samsung Moment today, Droid Eric over the weekend, and can't wait to get my hands on a Nexus One ... With 50 new Android phones coming out this year, an open app eco-system, and 4G coming out this year, I really can't wait to see the outcome ...

Oh, I was playing with some custom phones I bought from China with Video conferencing over Wifi and it works awesome... so 4G/Wiki, Android OS, free cloud hosting, Google Voice / other VoIP providers ... New communications are here, this will be an interesting year.

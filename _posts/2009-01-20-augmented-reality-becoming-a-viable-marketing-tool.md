If you're not familiar with augmented reality yet it is a technology that combines live video footage and computer graphics to create a whole new experience through the viewing window (typically either using a web cam or certain smart phones).

It works by providing the augmented reality software with some form of tracking marker that it knows to overlay 3 dimensional graphics over. The results are astounding - it truly allows consumers to feel as though you have brought a little piece of your imaginary world into their reality.

Right now marketers and technology innovators have done some very interesting examples of augmented reality using symbols printed locally and are then placed in front of your home web camera. Although I think this is fun and definitely buzz worthy I believe the true opportunity is in the not too distant future as more and more mobile phones adopt the technology. Image the potential of being able to re-invent outdoor and print marketing by adding an interactive component to almost any ad by just pointing your mobile device at it.

If you know of any other great examples please forward them to me. I have included a great example of a two player mobile game for Fanta developed by my friends over at the Hyper Factory as well a brilliant Papervision 3D and augmented reality combination.

Visit <a href="https://www.fanta.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fanta.eu</a> to watch a video of the Fanta game in action or actually use it with compatible smart phones.

Otherwise check out the video after the jump.

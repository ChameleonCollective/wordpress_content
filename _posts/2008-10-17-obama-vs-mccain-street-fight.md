Avenue Fighter 2008, "Battle for the White House" is a political fighting game that is controlled by the current tweets (messages) appearing on <a class="links" href="https://twitter.com/">Twtter.com</a>.Â  Once running, the game scans <a class="links" href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> for new tweets containing either McCain or Obama, and weighs the phrase as positive or negative.

The weighted phrases are then used to determine each candidate's attacks. Theoretically every fight is different as it's based on the tweets that are happening at that moment.

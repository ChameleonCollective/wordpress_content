Coca-Cola Europe launched an interesting project for Sprite earlier this month that I think is worth noting.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/greeneyedworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Green Eyed World" is a video series revolving around a 23-year old singer from London</a> as she looks to fulfill her dream of becoming a star. The audience is able to influence her choices as she journey's through the music world by commenting and voting on the site.

The audience can follow and interact with this 23-year old singer from London as she creates new opportunities for herself by following her dream.  By joining her journey online, the audience can influence her choices through commenting and voting directly in the GREEN EYED WORLD videos using their own Facebook profile.

The interesting twist is that the highly customized YouTube channel doesn't include the familiar comments that we're used to using, but only allows users to comment by logging in with their Facebook credentials via Facebook Connect. This function makes each comment act as a seeding element for the campaign across your friend's list as well as allows you to easily see what your other friend's have said about the episode.

This use of Facebook Connect stood out to me because it was completely replacing a very familiar commenting system, but I think it works for this branded entertainment campaign. The quality of the video looks solid. The videos views aren't particularly high yet, but I think this could be very interesting to see how it plays out as it's too early to see how successful it's going to be.

The "Episode Zero" show will be immediately followed by several viral extras on YouTube and Facebook updates from Katie leading up to premiere "Episode One" of "Season One" on May 1st. Viewers can also download a free application for their iPod/iPhone in time for the beginning of the season.

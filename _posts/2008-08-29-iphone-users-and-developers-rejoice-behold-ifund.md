If anyone doubted the momentum behind the value of iPhone applications this should give them something to ponder.

The investment firm KPCB has created a new fund dedicated to investing in cutting edge iPhone applications that leverage the functionality that is available in Apple's latest release. Shockingly it's called the iFund - I know you could have seen that one coming...

Regardless, it's a great idea and should further propel top quality developers and big idea people to dedicated time and resources to release even more cutting edge applications.

I know some gaming applications have had over 400,000 paid downloads establishing the iPhone as a legitimate gaming platform as well.

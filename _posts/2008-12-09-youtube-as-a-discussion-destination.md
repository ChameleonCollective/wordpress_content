Guitar virtuoso Joe Satriani has <a title="BBC Coverage of Satriani Vs. Coldplay" href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7766683.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sued</a> Coldplay for copyright infringement over claims that their hit single, Viva La Vida, used "substantial original portions" of his song If I Could Fly from 2004, seeking damages for "any and all profits." The lawsuit has been filed in Los Angeles federal court.

Chris Martin has said: "We're definitely good, but I don't think you can say we're that original. I regard us as being incredibly good plagiarists." I bet he wishes he hadn't said that now... <!--more-->

Though what really caught my attention with all this is yet another use for YouTube. A video titled "<a title="YouTube Video of Satriani Vs. Coldplay" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ofFw9DKu_I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Coldplay copy Joe Satriani?</a>" was uploaded to YouTube comparing both songs and asking people to comment, using YouTube as a destination for generating discussions based on a hypothesis presented in a video format. The video is less than a week old and has over 1.5 million views and almost 12,000 comments.

With that said, I wish YouTube had a better comment management and filtering, allow to search on comments, filter by date, rating, display only your friends' comments, etc ...

So we've seen YouTube being used for entertainment, news, learning, gaming, advertising, and discussions... I can see YouTube using <a title="Take Me To Your Leader on Google Friend Connect" href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/2008/08/25/keep-your-eye-on-google-friend-connect/">Google Friend Connect</a> or if Google is smart, even <a title="Take Me To Your Leader on Facebook Connect" href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/2008/12/08/google-friend-connect-is-live-but-so-is-facebook-connect/">Facebook Connect</a> to gain a few new million users

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 19th, we hosted a Future of Retail Dinner at the fabulous penthouse loft of Laurel Touby and Jon Fine. The main item on the agenda was “where is retail going and how do you get ahead of the game?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dinner was co-hosted by Charlie Cole (Tumi), Laurel Touby (Flatiron Investors) and Veronika Sonsev (Chameleon Collective) and included executives from Kate Spade, HBC Digital, Coach, Adidas, Equinox, NY &amp; Company and more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We asked each of the executives attending to share an innovation priority that they are currently focused on or interested in learning about, and we got quite an amazing list:</span>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Personalization</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- E-gifting</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Bots/conversation commerce</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Digital store technology</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Connecting bluetooth to identity</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- AR/VR</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Underlying ecommerce platforms</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt like the conversations could have gone on all night. Here are some photos from the event.</span>

I've been trying to simplify my life online life only in hopes of being able to cram more work into less time. This becomes increasingly difficult when you have a challenging job, a girlfriend, and a border line obsessive compulsive disorder about the social media space.

I've found myself increasingly looking to aggregation tools to simplify each thing I do on a daily basis. I'm going to share at least one a week for the next couple of weeks.

<a title="Ping.fm" href="https://www.ping.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ping.fm</a> is one of my favorites that I used on a daily basis without fail. It allows you to use a multitude of different methods from Instant Messenger to email to update your status on sites from twitter to Linkedin and everything in between.

Currently I'm using AIM as the input method and it's updating twitter, Facebook, Myspace, LinkedIn, Brightkite, Plaxo Pulse, Delicious, Wordpress, and Bebo in one shot.

Right now ping.fm is in the second round of their private beta, but if you visit the site and use the passcode "<span class="betacode">vivalaping" you'll be able to sign up now. I encourage you to visit <a title="Ping.fm" href="https://www.ping.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.ping.fm</a> and check it out.

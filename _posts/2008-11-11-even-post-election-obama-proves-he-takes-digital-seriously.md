Obama's digital team is hard at work again. Within 24 hours of winning the historic voite change.gov was launched. The new site transitions the focus away from winning the vote and on to streamlining the transitional period and establishing an ongoing dialog with the citizens of the United States.

The commitment to digital as a communication medium has proven effective for Obama which leads one to ponder what else will be communicated via from the Oval office in the future.

Sites like TechPresident.com which billiantly track the technical ascendancy of our two candidates and how they compare have made predictions that Obama will release his weekly address online and on video sharing sites like YouTube. They predict "town halls" will be facilitated online allowing citizens to make sure their voice is heard. They remind us of the digitally savy nature of his campaign, but most of all they predict he'll be our first tech president even adding a chief technical officer to his chief advisors.

I'm inclined to agree, but as we marvel at this achievement we also need to understand the implications. The success of this campaign and soon to be realized success of the leveraging digital to manage his presidency's communication will establish a paradigm shift in the way politics and government policy are communicated. He's the first, but we're about to see a long line of (hopefully) successful imitators.

My prediction is that the web and certain variations of social media will engage citizens on a whole new level. Participation will increase as it becomes easy to rally around ideas, add your voice in a simple and easy way, and find like minded souls. It's hard to not acknowledge the fact that convenience and minimal commitment might also play a factor in this new generation of digitally savvy political activists.

We had record turn-outs for voters this election. Imagine the participation level if you could vote from home via the Internet. I wonder how long it will take for that to become reality?

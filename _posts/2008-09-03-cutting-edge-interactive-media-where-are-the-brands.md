Over the last couple months I've run across two brilliant examples of cutting edge media. They could be used for a brand with potentially profound results in terms of the online buzz that could be created around it if released with a world class PR team. Each time I see one of these I get excited at it's potential, but I struggle to find clients who are willing to take the risk to try something new.

The two I'd really like to share, and I hope they get your imaginations going involve a video wall revolving around interactive water and a new holographic 3D technology that will leave almost any crowd with their mouth open.<!--more-->

The first project by Mark Burton of Northumbria University's Design School.
<blockquote>"Mark's 'Waterboard' uses the mixed media of new digital display technology with traditional pens and erasers to encourage creative thinking about the natural progression of the earth's water supply. It is a large, interactive installation that gives the user a chance to play with flowing water without getting wet, and consists of a wall-mounted white opaque board (2.2m x 8m) with four projectors and four cameras providing back-projection and detection. The sound of running water enhances the visuals. Several users can play at once, and can use the tools provided to draw or erase objects to try to control the flow of the water. The concept is playful, yet educational. The water will follow its own course, whatever the intervention. Abstract life forms may appear in some areas of water and where the water is stagnant it will become cloudy and discoloured."</blockquote>

The video demonstrates some technology from the company Arena 3D. I've done some research on several of these firms and I'm most impressed with what I've seen here. Quite a few brands have used this technology and a comparable technology (Musion) was even used for a Gorrilaz peformance at the MTV music awards a couple of years ago.

The real question for us as marketers, and in some cases technologists, how do we apply these in more innovative scenarios than have been done before. How do we create compelling pieces that engage consumers, excite the media, and in a best case scenario create an extended shelf life in the online space.

Why shouldn't we make a version of the interactive wall for Vitamin Water (Coca-Cola) or a interactive 3d holographic display that allows people to play football between London and NY during the world cup.

The future is for those that have courage - take hold of these initiatives and don't regret it when your competitors beat you to market and you're reading about their success.

I just wanted to give a little public shout-out to my friends Rob Gonda and Jeff Arbour. Rob, my brilliant co-author, has just been ranked the #9 person under 30 to watch out for in digital media.

My friend Jeff Arbour from Hyperfactory scooted in at #1. I'm glad to see I'm in such good company!
Congrats guys!

"This first set of ads features Bill Gates and comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Think of these ads as an icebreaker to reintroduce Microsoft to viewers in a consumer context. Later this month, as the campaign moves into its next phase, we’ll go much deeper in telling the Windows story and celebrating what it can do for consumers at work, at play and on-the-go." explains Microsoft SVP Bill Veghte, in an internal email to all employees.

That explanation is as lame and as boring as the <a title="Microsoft Jerry Seinfeld Bill Gates ad" href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/2008/09/05/microsoft-seinfeld-gates-apple-beware/">ad itself</a>. I hope CPB has something better than celebrating what Windows can do for consumers at work if the campaign is supposed to be compared to the hilarious Mac vs. PC ads.

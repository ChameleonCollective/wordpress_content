We live in a marketing world fascinated with talk of Facebook, YouTube, and MySpace. They're the first thing that jump to mind when you discuss social media or social networks with perhaps a distant 4th being the omni-present "blogosphere". As we descend on each network voraciously it's easy to forget to step back sometimes and really evaluate who you're reaching through each network.

I stumbled across a useful <a href="https://www.ignitesocialmedia.com/2008-social-network-analysis-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> at Ignite's social media blog. You can download the <a href="https://www.ignitesocialmedia.com/2008-social-network-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social network demographic document</a> I'm referencing here.

It brings together demographic data like the gender, age, education, and household income of it's user base in conjunction with a google trends graph indicating search volume for the domain over time by country. Obviously the google trends data isn't a clear indicator of site traffic, but it should be able to give you a good idea of the traffic a site might get in relation to another by using sites like Facebook and MySpace as a benchmark. Facebook receives about 4 million unique visitors a day these days and MySpace comes in at about 3.5 million.

Here were the data points that I found really interesting and stood out to me, but I encourage you to dig in yourself and see what you notice.
<ul>
 	<li>It seemed like there was a trend for there to be a skew towards female users on social networks, but towards men on social news sites.</li>
 	<li>I was surprised to see how heavily used business social networks are by users over 45. In most cases it seems like almost 45% of LinkedIn and Plaxo were over 45 years old.</li>
 	<li>MySpace skews younger and towards a less educated lower income group in comparison to Facebook. It also has a disproportionately higher number of female users. (Ironically I met my girlfriend of almost three years on MySpace.)</li>
 	<li>Across almost all instances I found the indication of usage in different countries in Africa, South America, and Asia particularly interesting particularly for networks founded in the west.</li>
 	<li>Bebo, Lambored, and Habbo are some of the few social networks that seem to be a great place to reach youth in an environment that seems more focused on their culture.</li>
 	<li>Anyone who reads this and doesn't believe social networks have gone mainstream and that it's without question no longer skewed to youth is insane.</li>
</ul>

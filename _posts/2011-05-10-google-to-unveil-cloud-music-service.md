Google, like Amazon, hasn’t secured licenses from the four major recorded-music companies, according to these people, and is likely to include a system that functions much like a remote hard drive. Users of the service are expected to be able to listen to songs they have uploaded to the service in a so-called streaming mode but won’t be able to download the files themselves.<!--more-->

It’s funny how Google follows every amazon stop … Amazon Elastic Computing (EC2) -&gt; Google App Engine … Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) -&gt; Google Storage for Developers … Amazon Cloud Drive / Player -&gt; Google Cloud Drive / Player …

With Google’s amazing track record (of zero) of building friendly services and applications, I don’t expect their music locker to really take off … especially again if it’s based on Google Storage for Developers, which is not being used by any developer.

Google, do you want to really get anywhere with this? Buy <a title="Home Music and Video Streaming Server" href="https://new.orb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orb</a>, scale it, embed it seamlessly into your cloud, and offer up the first cloud based full media center.

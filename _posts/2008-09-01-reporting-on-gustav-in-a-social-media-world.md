My heart goes out to the people who live in Louisiana who are probaby waiting in shelters and hotels in the surrounding areas praying with their families that their house is there when they get home.

I lost a home in 1992 to Hurricane Andrew and I can safely say it was devastating experience. I'll never forget driving back into the area and how it looked like a bomb had gone off. Nothing was familiar except the odd street sign that let me know I was on the right track. The pictures I've seen from the damage Katrina did the last time it powered up through the gulf put even Andrew to shame (mainly through the flooding damage).

Reporting the news on location during these times is difficult to say the least and it's hard to get first hand information, but a small group of Twitterers are online micro-blogging their way through the storm. It's pretty interesting to watch people use this platform as a secondary news platform.

I've been watching <a title="Mark Mayhew" href="https://twitter.com/MarkMayhew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/MarkMayhew</a>, although there are lots of others updating each other he's the only one that appears to be riding the storm out. Good luck Mark Mayhew!

UPDATE: Visit <a title="Twitter Search" href="https://search.twitter.com/search?q=gustav" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://search.twitter.com/search?q=gustav</a> to check out all the inputs coming in on the storm. They were coming in at a rate of almost 15 a minute when I wrote this.

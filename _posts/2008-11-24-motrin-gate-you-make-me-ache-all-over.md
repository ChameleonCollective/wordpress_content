There's a great summary of the Motrin social media mishap titled "<a href="https://adage.com/article?article_id=132787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crashing Motrin-gate: a Social Media Case Study</a>" on AdAge. It does an excellent job of mapping out the starting point for the chatter and then the tipping point at which it explodes on twitter.

I have to questions whether I think this was worth pulling down for the brand though. I'd be interested to see what percentage of the 300 blog posts (301 counting this one) are from marketing or social media blogs/sites. I think this is a hot subject right now in marketing, but was it really that big when you look at it's impact on pop culture. Only a couple of hundred thousand people viewed this ad on YouTube. I feel like this might be media going nuts again and making a big deal out of a small fire.

Maybe there was a more intelligent way to respond to the community then issuing a very corporate apology, pulling your site down, and pulling this commercial. Based on some very interesting conversations I've been having with our own corporate communications department I've been thinking about the best ways for businesses/brands to respond to feedback in the social media space.

This could have been used to engage all of the naysayers into a bigger conversation and in the long term turn them into vocal brand advocates. They should personally message each of the people that commented on Twitter and ask them to get involved on their next ad (in terms of early feedback). Imagine the groundswell of buzz they'd be able to create...

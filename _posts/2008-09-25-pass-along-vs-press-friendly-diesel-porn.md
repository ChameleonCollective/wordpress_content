When I look at some of the most successful marketing campaigns I have been fortunate enough to be involved with I have started to realize that, in most cases, they fit into two categories. One category is projects that have a very high pass-along factor and the second is projects that have a very high pass-along factor and are very press friendly. These press friendly ideas, like Trevor The Mentos Intern or Guinness Hands for example, received exponentially more traffic because of their original content that truly was unlike almost anything on the web at the time of their release. When bloggers received links from us or tips from friends it was easy for them to find a reason to write about it in the hopes that they'd publish before anyone else or felt a sincere need to tell their friends.

These ideas aren't always the most sane (yet again, reference Trevor The Mentos Intern) and in some cases they're not particularly politically correct. The fashion company Diesel seems to have a really good grasp of how to make these press friendly viral campaigns. They did it very successfully last year when they had two models "kidnap" a sales person and the company's primary website while interacting with visitors via a live web cam.

I think they're about to do it again with a unique spin on some carefully edited 70's porn that apparently reflects what Diesel's 30th birthday celebration party was like...

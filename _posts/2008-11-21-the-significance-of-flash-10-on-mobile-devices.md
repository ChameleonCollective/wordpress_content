As Rob pointed out in an earlier post <a href="https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200811/111708ARMAdobeFlash.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe announced that Flash 10 would be released for mobile devices with an ARM processor</a> in 2009. It's easy to skate past this fairly technical sounding press release if you're in the marketing world, but the implications of what this will do to the mobile marketing landscape are amazing.

For starters ARM devices will be able to view the same Flash sites that traditional Internet users do as opposed to the Flash Mobile only sites they see now. This is somewhat like what the iPhone browser did for regular website browsing.

Smart marketers will still offer experiences that are designed for a mobile experience (i.e. smaller screens, potentially slower bandwidth) but now they won't be limited in terms of the complexity or media richness. Flash 10 will allow rich mobile experiences that will easily stream video (HD and regular) and integrate with systems like Flash Media Server 2 for collaborative multi-user experiences.

Kevin Lynch from Adobe shows a demo on a G1 after the jump. Now I just want to see it on a iPhone!

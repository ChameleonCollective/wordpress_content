This is a smart move on Coke's end. Everyone knows that Coke mainly targets teens, and what if instead of marketing to teens, you get teens come to you, promote you, share, chat, and advocate your brand? Dream came true ...

Coke organized this experimental amazing hangout villa they called The Coca Cola Village. They've been doing it for a few years, or at least I found videos from 2008 and 2009.<!--more-->

This year's was a little different though, an Israeli agency called E-dologic -- part ofÂ Publicis, extended the event in effort to bring the Facebook "Like" to the real world. Not only they invited thousands of teens who talk about this through traditional word-of-mouth, but they used the <a title="Facebook Presence RFID Events" href="https://www.facebook.com/presence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Presence</a>-like concept where they distribute teens a wristband, they link it to their Facebook account, and the village automatically digitalize, archive, organize, and share their experience. It makes it easy to re-live the fun, read the comments, see their friends, share activities, and for Coke? instant-massive-ultra-influencing system that leverages teens to promote Coke's brand among their circles.

Really nicely done. As expected, Facebook will keep penetrating the real-world. Next efforts will probably use the open graph to describe more precise locations and describe relationships among people, places, and objects.

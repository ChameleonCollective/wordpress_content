<em>Do you see iPad traffic on iPad content? Is this a cult or a coincidence?</em>

If you know me, I am obsessed with analytics ... So I noticed today a massive spike in mobile traffic:

Interesting ... I did change something this week, I finally added tracking to the iPhone template ... but that was not it.

I checked top content people are browsing through mobile and I found a couple of curious facts ...

1) iPad users had much longer sessions than web users ... apparently their exploring the site and discovering new content, as opposed to web users who found the site through a link, read the article, and leave.

2) 90% of the iPad traffic went to post I wrote Wednesday about <a title="Adobe for iPad – Need to Step up on Experience" href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/2010/07/21/adobe-for-ipad-need-to-step-up-on-experience/">Adobe trying to get into the iPad</a>. In fact, more people visited that post from an iPad than any other OS:

Wow, iPad at 37.81%, very impressive. What's also impressive is that iPad + iPhone + Android = 46% and Mac + Windows = 52% ... Mobile is almost surpassing all desktop traffic on this one.

So now I'm totally curious to see where is this traffic coming from. Is it that iPad users search to iPad content? Are they such Mac-heads? Or is it that Google has special algorithms based on device, and return iPad related content in iPad based searches? Or is it a community thing where someone found it and posted into an iPad blog or forum that's only browser through iPads? I'm not making any sense, am I?

Let's see, analytics should tell us:

The answer is: I have no idea ... all this spike in traffic is coming from an iPad with direct traffic ... and I also checked if it was a bot, but apparently they're all unique users ...

So question to you: do you see iPad traffic on iPad content? Is this a cult or a coincidence?

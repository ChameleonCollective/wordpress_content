Someone recently tipped me off to a great banner execution for Burger King courtesy of Crispin Porter. I really respect great banner executions as you have so many more restrictions. It truly proves how far you can take the medium when you want to.

My gut tells me they were not able to run it like this on many sites, but I thought you'd enjoy it anyway. As always BannerBlog had it first...

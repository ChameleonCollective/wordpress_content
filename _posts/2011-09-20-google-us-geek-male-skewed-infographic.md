Google+ now finally open to the public "might" make me change my perception. Google+ (plus) launched early July on an invite only basis, which seems to have heavily skewed towards a geeky male US-based audience. At the moment, Google+ really has nothing to offer in the social end ... yes, the way you organize friends is better (IMO) than Facebook, and ... ... ... well, that's it ... You might have heard me claim that it will compete against iCloud in the quest to conquer your hard data (photos, videos, music, files) - but that's another post on its own.

The first Google+ infographic was released an the numbers pretty much confirm it: 26 million users, 100% of which work in software engineering, web development, advertising, or related careers. Should be interesting to watch it shift (or not) now that Google+ is open to the public.<!--more--><img style="float: left;" title="inforgaphics_google_plus.jpg" src="https://takemetoyourleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/inforgaphics_google_plus.jpg" alt="Inforgaphics google plus" width="600" height="1828" border="0" />

I'm going to file this one under WTF, but it has some interesting features.

Nico Nico Douga is one of the most popular video sharing sites in Japan. The very unique feature they have is that users leaving comments on videos appear in an overlay in real time. This allows comments to be timed to certain aspects of the video adding relevant thoughts at the appropriate time. Some users have even used it to add sub titles to their video.

I think this is a great addition. I've been watching YouTube for some time waiting for a comparable feature to appear. I'm suprised they haven't tested even a prototype to see if western culture makes this as much as phenomenom as the Japanese did for Nico Nico Douga.<!--more-->

Now with all of that said - try and watch this video of some kind of Ronald McDonald from hell without your head exploding.... Ah, I love Japanese culture.

PS - Recently I found a new guitly pleasure. It's a Japanese game show called Ninja Warrior that they are airing on G4. It's basically the hardest obstacle course I've ever seen. Only one guy has beaten it in the 14 seasons of the show. I strongly suggest watching it - even my girlfriend finds it amusing. If nothing else listening to the announcer in Japanese makes my day.

I finally managed to get over to the Apple store in Shanghai today. Even though I'm unabashedly addicted to technology I'm not the type to hang out in the long opening lines, but I was thrilled to come see the amazing new location today with some of the team from SapientNitro. It's everything you'd expect of Apple's flagship store for China. It's beautiful, ambitious, and as with most things in Shanghai... BIG. I ended up filming the experience on my iPhone 4 (appropriately), edited it in iMovie, and then uploaded for your pleasure.

Enjoy!

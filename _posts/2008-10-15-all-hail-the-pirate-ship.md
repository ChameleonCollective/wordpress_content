I just got back from Boston after speaking at the New Marketing Summit. I met a lot of nice and interesting people and hopefully left a positive impression on the crowd.

I got to meet up with one of my favorite bloggers, who coincidentally organized the event, Chris Brogan. He wrote a great piece this week that echoes my sentiment of taking bold moves in a recession and using it as an opportunity to leave a mark in the marketing landscape.

He also used a metaphor of pirates and a pirate ship which pretty much guarantees instant inclusion into this blog. If you haven't read Chris' blog before you should check it out.

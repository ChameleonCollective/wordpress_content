This week I had a friend make a digital copy of my log book that I’ve been keeping since I was a kid. It has every flight I’ve ever taken in it since I was just over 3 months old. I’ve accumulated over 700 flights and 150 trans Atlantic crossings and I still take it on every flight. When I board the plane I give the book to the captain (typically through a flight attendant) and have the book recorded and signed in their own hand writing.

It is truly my most prized possession in the world as it's the only material possession I own that's not replaceable.

I thought it was about time I did this for safety’s sake if nothing else.

Check it out here: <a href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/logbook" target="_self">https://takemetoyourleader.com/logbook/</a>

I recommend jumping to the 20th page where all the flights start, but the comments the captains leave are really classic ranging from funny to sentimental and they get better and better as time goes on and the book becomes a rich piece of history. I've had captains tell me their father's had signed it or that they signed it once before 10 years ago.

I'm going to add a permanent menu link to the site to access the book and will keep it updated. I'm doing about 80 flights a year right now so it changes pretty rapidly.

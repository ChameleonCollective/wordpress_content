I've decided that I've been under utilizing twitter almost as much as I've been under utilizing this blog. Without exaggerating I get 10 to 15 interesting pieces of work or top notch articles sent to me via email each day and I never even begin to blog about them all. I find myself saving drafts on articles and then not publishing them.

What does that mean for you? For starters you're missing out on some really fun, innovative, and/or inspiring work. I've decided I'm going to try and pass along at least 3 a day from now on.

It's that time of year again and I'll be heading out to another interesting week in the south of France checking out some of the best work in the world, meeting with the media, and trying my best to get myself and the SapientNitro crew into the most fun parties. This year has a new unusual twist for me on a personal level. I've quit drinking so that I can successfully quit smoking. No smoking for one month as of tomorrow. If I can make it through the Lions without drinking or smoking I'll be feeling more confident that I've finally kicked the world's worst habit...

On the work front I'll be running a workshop with Nathaniel Perez, SapientNitro's social media whiz, focusing on location based marketing called "How To Create Location-Based Mobile Marketing (Shhhh ... Without An Expert)" on Friday morning. If you're in town I encourage you to check it out. Also Laura McFarlane will be leading a discussion with Ian Maskel from Unilever featuring our next generation vending machine that utilizes facial recognition technology for a very unique customer experience.

We've also got a very unique location based game that works in the spirit of the childhood favorite game Marco Polo. Rob and I will tell you more in an upcoming post that will really break the details down.

In the mean time enjoy this wonderful comic from WordsAndPictures. If you don't read them already <a href="https://www.wordsandpicturesonline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit their site</a> and subscribe to their content. It's fantastic.

This pretty much sums up the most perfect guide to French for the week I've seen....

<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 16px 0px 16px 0px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1059 alignnone" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="MMS_update" src="https://takemetoyourleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/MMS_update.jpg" alt="MMS_update" width="517" height="217" /></p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 16px 0px 16px 0px;">Finally, AT&amp;T’s long-awaited MMS update for the iPhone is finally ready. Just plug your iPhone into iTunes and hit the “Check for Update” button.</p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 16px 0px 16px 0px;">You should get the dialog message above, saying: “An update to your carrier settings for your iPhone is available. Would you like to download it now?”</p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 16px 0px 16px 0px;">Hit “Download and Update” and wait a few seconds, then go to your iPhone and launch the Messages app. There should be a little camera icon to the left of the text input box at the bottom. Hit it, and you’ll be able to send pictures or video with your text messages.</p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 16px 0px 16px 0px;">Some users are reporting they have to manually reboot their iPhone after installing the carrier update.</p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 16px 0px 16px 0px;">PS: Haven't tested if this has any effect on the tethering profile update</p>

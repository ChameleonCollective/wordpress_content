LinkedIn announced today that it's adding the ability to add custom applications to your profile page. It's based on the OpenSocial application development platform.

OpenSocial didn't take off nearly as fast as I thought it would. I had always assumed that when MySpace enabled it that adoption would pick-up rapidly. LinkedIn has now finally enabled it and I believe future tech like Google Friend Connect (which also uses OpenSocial) will really push this application platform over the top.

I installed two applications immediately. An application to quickly and easily port this blog to my profile as well an application that scans twitter with references to my company. The two apps are called Wordpress and Company Buzz respectively.

The installation was easy in terms of the number of clicks, but there were some bugs. LinkedIn didn't acknowledge that the application was complete and the apps were only working intermittently when I viewed my profile. On the basis that I got the email they were launching this at 12.21 AM and blogged about it at 1.35 AM I'm going to cut them some slack. Hopefully it will work a bit better by the time you check it out.

If you haven't got a LinkedIn profile yet your missing out. Social networking in the business space is equally as interesting as Facebook or MySpace. It's just harder to pick up a date on LinkedIn...

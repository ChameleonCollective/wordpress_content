Sapient launched the first part of it's digital campaign for Coca-Cola's Happiness Factory 3 last week. The project, one of my lifetime favorites, was truly built on the blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity, <em>and smiles</em> of a lot of people. The site took a very large team of creatives, designers, developers, IA, project managers, animators, and 3d specialists to create. <a href="https://hf3.coca-cola.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check it out here</a>.

I'm thrilled to announce that it won an <a href="https://www.thefwa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FWA</a> today! Hopefully this is a good sign and indication of a successful campaign that resonates with all who see it.

I also recommend checking out the <a href="https://www.messengercentral.co.uk/viewAll.aspx?moduleId=38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HF3 MSN Messenger games</a> we created with Microsoft. Microsoft said they pushed the boundaries of the platform and the multi-player experience is pretty amazing.

We've got some more stuff in the cooker, but you'll just have to wait till it launches.

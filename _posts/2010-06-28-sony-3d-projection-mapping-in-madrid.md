Sony comes out with a new spin to 3d projection, now in Madrid. Instead of going all fancy with braking and shattering buildings, they went with a simple elegant experiences that is cool not only because it's about 3d soccer experience just in time for the world cup, not only because it's the first one with real 3d illustrations, but also because they make use of the building's doors and windows to make it seem more real ... it seems like the building is part of it, not just a massive projection area.

Really well done Sony. This projection was again created by <a title="NuFormer 3d projection mapping Netherlands" href="https://www.nuformer.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NuFormer in the Netherlands</a> and I must say these guys would have to be one of the top mapping agencies out there. The creative concept, mapping precision and execution are simply stunning! I will say that I think the <a title="Samsung 3d projection" href="https://takemetoyourleader.com/2010/06/09/outdoor-3d-projection-taking-off/" target="_self">Samsung 3D Projection</a> was still more innovative in it’s concept and execution, but it's good to see with just 3 concepts out there how different they can be. Now where is the US one? There's a <a title="SapientNitro Miami Beach" href="https://www.sapient.com/en-us/Contact-Us/Global-Offices/Miami-Beach.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive white building</a> in Lincoln road with great exposure that would be ideal for it! Really, I'm sure Sapient will help negotiate and get all approvals to do it :)

Four marketers are teaming up to <a title="DreamWorks' &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens,&quot; PepsiCo's SoBe Lifewater, Intel and NBC Create 'Monstrous' 3D Super Bowl Event" href="https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20090105corp_a.htm?cid=rss-90004-c1-222686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air two commercials in super-fabulous 3-D</a> as part of a special "event" during this year's Super Bowl telecast on Feb. 1 to run the <span class="myst.item.description">first-ever all 3D Super Bowl commercial break.</span> The ads, which will run at the end of the second quarter will <span class="myst.item.description">mark the debut of DreamWorks Animation's premier 3D movie trailer for its upcoming feature film, "Monsters vs. Aliens" </span> and a 60-second spot in 3-D for PepsiCo's SoBe Lifewater. The other two marketers involved are Intel, which has made 125 million pairs of 3-D glasses for the occasion distributed by PepsiCo through the SoBe Lifewater brand, and NBC, this year's Super Bowl broadcaster, which will also air a 3-D episode of <em>Chuck</em> the following day (to be promoted under the slogan "Don't Chuck your glasses").

NBC viewers will be alerted to the SoBe Lifewater Super Bowl Displays via a series of tune-in spots airing beginning on January 19th. Displays and tune-ins will instruct viewers to use their 3D glasses on Super Bowl Sunday, with additional messaging, "Don't Chuck Your Glasses," prompting viewers to re-use them during the special 3D episode of "Chuck," which will feature a special guest appearance by NBC Sports analyst and Super Bowl champion Jerome Bettis.

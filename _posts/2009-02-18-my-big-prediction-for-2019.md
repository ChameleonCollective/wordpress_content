I was out with some friends having a drink tonight when the conversation sparked a memory of a big prediction I had a couple years back. Everyone thought it was a bit nuts, but in the interest of making it public record I'm going to share this prediction with you. Why do I need to make it public record? Well, according to my friends one or all of the following thing will happen if I'm right:
<ul>
 	<li>They will immediately pay me $1,000,000</li>
 	<li>Pigs will fly out of their asses and do some form of aerial acrobatic show.</li>
 	<li>Hell will not only freeze over, but Satan will open some form of ice skating rink that also serves free heart shaped lollipops.es</li>
</ul>
Now that I've got that out of the way I'm going to share one of my most far out predictions for the future. Call me crazy, but I truly believe this will become reality in our lifetime.

Does anyone remember  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BattleBots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BattleBots</a>? It was a series of tournaments where remote controlled robots loaded with weapons and a healthy dose of armor kicked the snot out of each other in an arena. It reached it's cultural peak in 2000 to 2002 when 5 tournaments were aired on Comedy Central.

The advancement of robotics over the coming ten years (and ongoing generations) will allow us to  build some fairly sophisticated robots. They'll be bigger, faster, be able to handle bigger weapons and sustain more damage.

I predict that in ten years time robotic combat will become a more frequently viewed televised sport and in the coming decades will become a major spectator sport.

The reality is we love violence and competition. It's evident in the sports we like from American football to Ultimate Fighting Championships. What boy wouldn't love to watch four eight-foot robots rip each other to shreds with machine guns, flame throwers, and modified chain saws?

Apparently ESPN has just licensed them for another seasons that's coming out in the spring of 2009. I'm interested to see how an updated version feels after 7 years off the air. Additionally it will be interesting to see how a sports network approaches it as opposed to a comedy channel.

Hopefully, you don't mind my deviation from trend watching in marketing and simultaneously don't think I've gone mad.

(I'll have the last laugh though.... Oh you'll see.... You'll see...)

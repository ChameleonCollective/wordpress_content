Rob and I will be taking a break for the next couple of weeks. We'll be back in full force on January 5th, but for now we're going to enjoy a well earned rest.

We're happy that you came along for the ride in 2008 and we hope you enjoyed reading TMTYL as much as we enjoyed writing it.

We wish you the best this holiday season. Have a wonderful and safe New Year's Eve celebration as well!

For now we'll fly off in our odd sci-fi advertising space wagon and dream of odd new things to tell in the new year.

Sincerely yours,

Freddie and Rob

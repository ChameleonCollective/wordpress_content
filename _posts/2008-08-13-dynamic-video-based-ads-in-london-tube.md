While I was in London I noticed these very interesting ads running on the video screens on the tube. They appeared to be dynamically updated with recent photos of the new British Airways Terminal 5 addition at Heathrow to show how open and quick the terminal was processing passengers.

Conceptually I think this is a great campaign idea. It's fun, appears to be honest transparent advertising, and uses technology/media in an innovative manner.

It appears they're updating the print campaign with fresh images on a daily basis when applicable as well.

This campaign was developed by BBH and Agency.com.

Check out the video below where it shows the terminal from 10 AM that day (or potentially the day before) being displayed in the tube's video screens. Fun stuff with a nice little musical interlude from the guitarist at the bottom of the escalator.

The thing I find most fascinating about this is the new opportunities it creates in terms of updating the digital signage on a frequent basis. I wasn't aware that media companies were willing to allow frequent updates of this magnitude. What else could we do that is that relevant and gets people's attention on a daily basis? My notepad is already filling up....

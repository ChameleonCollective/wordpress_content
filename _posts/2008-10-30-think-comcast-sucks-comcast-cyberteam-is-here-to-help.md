I use Comcast for my home internet service. The connection is fast and pretty reliable, but dealing with their customer service department is like dealing with wooden puppets who can't answer any question that doesn't come off a cue card. I'm not the first person to have a complaint like this and candidly if you spend anytime searching the web you'll find people with issues that range from annoying to shockingly bad.

They've managed to inspire a multitude of hate websites from ihatecomcast.com to comcastsucks.org. If you search Comcast on Google there is a video result showing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvVp7b5gzqU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comcast technician sleeping on a customer's couch</a>. I frequently talk about how a brand's perception is now being defined not only by their own messaging, but by the content consumers are creating and permeating search, media sharing sites, and viral jokes. Comcast is case study example number one.

Normally I like to pick on Comcast, but today I want to commend them. They've done something that every major business should do. They've created a team for searching for references or conversations about their brand and addressing them in a positive way. They're not slapping customers with law suits, but sending them messages of apology, encouragement, and advice. They're engaging in forums, comments on blogs, and sending personalized emails or phone calls.

This isn't propaganda. It's proactive customer service and it's the new model to create a positive customer experience. If your customer's are creating commentary on your brand and making it part of public record - why shouldn't you respond to them and add your two cents to the conversation. Ultimately that's what the social web is all about - collaboration, open communication, and community building.

Big business, if you're listening, this is the future. If you want to build a lasting relationship with your customers join their community and you'll always be remembered as a friendly face. Congrats to Frank Eliason, senior director of digital care, you're going to make a very positive impact on the business.

(Now let's see if any of they're people find this and leave a comment....)

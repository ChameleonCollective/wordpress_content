Today's award goes to <strong>iPhone4 vs HTC Evo</strong>. I'm sure most of you have seen it, but if you haven't, the video is a parody mocking Apple-heads / fans that blindly follow the brand for status ... It shows how Apple builds following through designing great experiences and even if other brands have better technology, they cannot match the feeling one gets when holding an iPhone.

This video came out the same day the iPhone4 was released, immediately rocked the charts, and keep going strong.

The creator of the video worked at Best Buy, who immediately suspended him -- creating some negative PR which shows you that even though Twelp won the Grand Prix at Cannes this Â year, Best Buy is still learning how to best leverage social media.

With talent like this, Best Buy should have done the total opposite and empowered the creator to build a follow up, embrace creativity to produce positive traction ...

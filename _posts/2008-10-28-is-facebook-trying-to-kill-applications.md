Everyone knows that we're very passionate about Facebook. We've been actively building Facebook applications since they first launched and consider them to be one of the fundamental differentiators that helped propel Facebook to such lofty heights.

Facebook embraced what I believe builds the most successful new model businesses successes on the web. They created an open platform and let user innovation drive the direction of their business. Unfortunately, like most open platforms, it got out of control. People abused their rights in an effort to push their application to the top. The constant stream of invitations to join applications became one of the number one gripes of Facebook users as they felt they were being aggressively "spammed" (even if it was by their friends).

Facebook has been re-evaluating it's infrastructure quite a bit these days. A new Facebook layout, for better or worse, has been released. Additionally they have been making some heavy changes to how applications were handled within the system beyond the presentation layer.

The obvious change that you would have noticed includes shifting all of your applications mini-views to a tab on your profile called "Boxes". Really? They couldn't name it "applications" or "apps" so it was even mildly intuitive. It's bad enough that they're now treating the application concept they popularized as the ugly step-child, but this is just adding insult to injury. I wish they made the tab name "don't click here" - it would probably get more people to check it out.

Beyond the user interface changes the whole process of migrating to the new system was painful for both our team and our clients. Applications stopped functioning properly and this lead to poor experiences for our application's users. The latest news is that once a user has opted to install an application they will have to go to a separate page to enable the mini-view for the "boxes" page and also to allow for mini-feeds that include pictures. This will effectively inhibit the experience on all new installations on existing and new applications.

This could have all been avoided with better communication and coordination.

Facebook as a company embraced working with the general public (which included bed room developers and global digital agencies like Sapient) and for this I applauded them. We all happilly contributed our time, experience, and money to create an enriched experience for Facebook's users. Unfortunately Facebook runs their development process with complete disregard for it's users. This was obvious in the way they handled Beacon and it became obvious again in the way they're now handing applications.

Now Facebook application developers are having to re-design their applications to make them successful within the new rules. I'm not convinced that older applications are going to re-engineer very well, but there is almost certainly an opportunity to design a clever application that plays within the rules and focus on the incredibly mini-feed centric new layout.

Unfortunately I think this has really left a bitter taste in the application development community. As we watch diminishing returns on our applications will we be motivated to continue to develop them? I'm not concerned that irreparable damage has been done to the application platform in terms of it's perception by users and developers. If nothing else it's going to take sometime for it to recover and people to find a balance that allows it to return to it's exciting beginnings.

There were so many smarter ways to handle this. Couldn't they have taken the "like / don't like" functionality on the mini-feed and aggregated the sentiment globally and used this information to push down all overly intrusive and annoying applications?

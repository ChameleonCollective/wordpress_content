In my previous post I talked about the concept of micro-celebrities. Where are some of these micro-celebrities and how do we use them help us launch products.

Look to Personal Blogging, Fanfiction Writing, Podcasting, Video Blogging, and even the profile pages of your friends on social networking sites. (The other option is to create your own micro-celebrities like Trevor the Mentos Intern, but we’ll get to that in a second.)

It’s about connecting with key influencers who seem ultimately more believable, more sincere, and more likely to be like “you and me” and not big corporate companies that want more of your money. Sadly, I am frequently compelled to remind our clients that most people don’t like advertising right before I ask for a raise in their marketing budget, but we try our best not to make traditional ads.

The internet provides a voice that cannot only be heard, but can be specifically targeted. There are hundreds of examples of on the web where a single individual has created a voice for themselves, and hundreds have gathered to listen.

We use bloggers and all different forms of micro-celebrities to help us promote our client’s brands. Our relationship with these communities and the new ones we form everyday help us to continue to build brand relevance, but we do it by treating these people like, well, micro-celebrities. We respect them, we praise they’re work, and through strong bonds we typically don't have to pay them to reference our client's brands.

Beau Bergeron, a senior at FIU, has gained national fame for starting the Great Underwear Dash, an event celebrated annually on campuses across the country. He’s also gained fame for a double-album he produced himself.
This is an example of one person whose voice is heard all over the country. He’s not spending hours campaigning, or spending time throwing his name up on every wall he can find. He’s just publicized his personal projects on his blog, and has gained national attention for it. This year, he’s even turned the underwear dash into a charity event. By encouraging people to donate the clothes they take off to run, a single individual is able to make a huge influence.

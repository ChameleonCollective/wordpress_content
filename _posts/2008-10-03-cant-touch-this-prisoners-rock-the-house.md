I'm going to categorize the following under our new "WTF" category. Many of you may have seen one of the predecessor videos which consisted of hundreds of orange suited prisoners from Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center in the Philippines dancing to Michael Jackson's Thriller.

Beyond the fact that this is damn amusing I actually think it's pretty great that the prison endorses this unusual method of rehabilitation. The prisoners must know that well over 30 million people have watched their performances and this must give them some sense of pride.<!--more-->

Apparently they've been the subject of two documentaries now and they even open the prison on Saturday for two hours to allow guests to come watch their performances.

Enjoy and have a wonderful weekend!

There's no question that TV &amp; Social Web are closed together, just like pretty much everything social. From xbox live joint movie watching, to Google TV, and now Comcast's Tunerfish.

Comcast's Plaxo acquisition has borne fruit beyond its social media address book roots with <strong>Tunerfish</strong>, aimed at pulling social networking features and TV into one website. Currently in closed alpha, it lets TV watchers note what they're watching and share with others, Foursquare style... so you check-in a show, check how many people have checked in, and keep an eye on what's trending amongst the larger pool of viewers or just your friends. Of course there's Facebook and Twitter integration, and an iPhone app will be available when the beta launches in the next few weeks.

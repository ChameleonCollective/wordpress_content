I've handled two keynotes in the last couple months for both the Figaro Social Media Conference and the Social Media World Forum, both in London, in the last five Â months that I really enjoyed working on. The first of those two presentations is called Social Media 2012 and thanks to some persistent poking I've been encouraged to put them up on SlideShare including a full audio voice over.

Social Media 2012 focuses on new innovations in social media that are just starting to appear in production or experimental forms and that I believe will be future trends to watch as marketers. Regardless of your knowledge level with social media you will find content in here that you have not heard or seen before and I hope you find it as inspiring to listen to as I found it to research and develop for this presentation.

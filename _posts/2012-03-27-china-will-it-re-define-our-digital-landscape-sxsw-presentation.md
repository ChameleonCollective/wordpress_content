If you're interested in China and how the digital and social media landscape will evolve globally in the next 15 years then you'll find this interesting.

I wanted to share the presentation I gave at SXSW this year. I have uploaded it to SlideShare and also embedded the live audio taken at the event.

I'd like to give a special thanks to my colleagues in the Shanghai office for helping me to learn about China and answering all my unusual questions. I hope they feel this presentation represents that I was listening, learning, and have a genuine admiration for their country.<!--more-->

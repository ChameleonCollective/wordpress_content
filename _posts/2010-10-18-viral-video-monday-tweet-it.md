Another great one for our Viral Video Mondays: A decidedly tech-flavored parody of Michael Jackson’s “Beat It” featuring iPads, iPhones and Twitter.

Straight from the twisted minds of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pantlessknights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pantless Knights</a> — the same guys who brought you “New Dork” and “I’m on a Mac” — comes “Tweet It,” a reimagining of “Beat It” that pits iPads versus iPhones.<!--more-->

Here're the lyrics for you to follow along:

I told you, don't write no more letters to me
Don't wanna read no more, You know I'm A.D.D.
I start to watch Glee, it's really fast on 4G
So tweet it, just tweet it
You better type, you better do it real fast
Don't go above the 140 letter max
Remember some devices do not support Flash
So tweet it, while you're clearin your cache!
CHORUS
Just tweet it, tweet it, tweet it, tweet it
Justin Bieber gets defeated!
We're all micro-bloggers, with a device
In YouTube comments, we win the fights
Just tweet it, tweet it
Just tweet it, tweet it
Just tweet it, tweet it
Just tweet it, tweet it
You wanna go beyond emoticon frowns
Don't wanna use a gun, your twitter gets a round
You're Siskel and you're Ebert, please don't put your thumbs down
So Tweet it, just tweet it
You got an iPhone and you gotta be glad
Until you saw your Dad whip out his new iPad
You want an iPatch, gonna be the new fad
So Tweet it, cuz you gotta beat Dad!
CHORUS
[Guitar Solo]
CHORUS
Tweet it, tweet it, tweet it, tweet it
Kids with A.D.D. can read it
Show 'em, they're hungry, for your insight
It doesn't matter, if you can't write
Tweet it, tweet it, tweet it, tweet it
Get this hashtag retweeted!
Trends that keep rockin', with you all night
ROTFL from Pantless Knights!

The second Microsoft "Bill and Jerry" ad is online today. It already had over 300,000 views by the time I was able to make some time to look at it.

Several people have been quick to point out it feels almost like an episode of the American comedy "Arrested Development". It's quirkiness is somewhat endearing and I think the fact that they're willing to poke fun at themselves for being disconnected and not relevant was a smart move.

They also revealed the new "Perpetually Connecting" tag line. Anything that supports the perpetual networking of not only technology but the social web is something I think is highly relevant in today's world.<!--more-->

I'd be really interested to hear your feedback. Please leave a comment and let all us and all of our readers know your thoughts.

MINOR DIGRESSON:

I find using YouTube as a way to get instant feedback on videos quite revealing. Reading the comments was almost as interesting as watching the video itself. I was thinking it would be interesting to be able to get this same kind of instant feedback on a website. Theoretically this would be not only possible but very easy using Google Friend Connect.

You may have have noticed we've added the sign-up process for Google Friend Connect to the right hand column of this site. We'll be adding the actual page functionality next week and will post and official launch of the additional functionality.

Earlier this month I was able to visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeBIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CeBIT</a>, the world's largest technology show case, in Hannover, Germany. The exhibition space is absolutely enormous totally over 5,000,000 square feet. Imagine the biggest convention center building you've ever seen then imagine at least 20 buildings of that size and you'll have an idea of how big CeBIT is.

I was able to meet some brilliant people from around the world, speak on a panel about social media, and be exposed to some great bleeding edge technology. All in all it was a great couple of days (even though I missed my flight on the way back).

Most buildings were focused on one subject that included green technologies, security, enterprise network technology, mobile, GPS, computers, gaming, or my personal favorite "the future parc". The future parc was focused on innovative new technologies whether they had been productised or not. You could look at technologies at an early stage with the potential that you might see a new opportunity for it's use.

I've highlighted some of my favorite items below that I saw during the conference. Some are really far out and some are fairly simple - I hope you enjoy the quick summary.

<a href="https://www.aiptek.eu">AIPTEK</a> - This German company has produced a very small lightweight project that fits into the palm of your hand. It's got no where near the kind of power you'd need to do a full blow presentation at good quality, but it would be great for projecting movies from an portable device like an iPod or iPhone onto the wall. Another nifty feature includes an oboard memory card so you can just store movies in the device and avoid the third party portable device all together. It's still early days, but very cool none the less.

<a href="https://www.globalemotion.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Emotion</a> - This wasn't actually a piece of technology, but it stood out to me for two reasons. One, I have full intentions of living in Asia this year and two I just thought it addressed a very interesting issue for westerners trying to do business in China. iWays is offering a course that allows you to learn to understand the body language and facial expressions of the Chinese people in comparision to some western body language that might cause you to mis-understand a business situation. I could see how this could be invaluable in today's world.

<a href="https://www.gesturetek.com">GestureTek</a> - These guys are doing some amazing interactive displays. They're doing everything from massive table top displays that allow you to drag content around with your finger and close and expand additional content at will to touchless screens that react just based on the movement of your hands. It's starting to feel really futuristic.

Another cool product they had on display was called "The Cube". It was a self contained and portable system for doing projected interactive displays that react to gesture control. Imagine for example projecting a bunch of lilly pads onto the floor that when you moved near them with your feet bounced and rippled in reaction to your motion. This is definitely eye catching stuff. I still think they haven't unleashed some top level creative talent onto it yet, so they're still a lot of room to do some amazing things.

<a href="https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fraunhofer Institute</a> - The Fraunhofer Institute booth took the cake for me for most mind blowing innovations (with actual working prototypes). Some of the highlights included:
<ul>
 	<li>Flat panel TVs that displayed near perfect 3D imagery without the need for 3D glasses.</li>
 	<li>3D digital dashboards for automobiles that also reacted and tracked your eye movement.</li>
 	<li>Real-time facial expression analysis that could identify your gender and mood.</li>
 	<li>A digital wardrobe where you could change the color and design on your clothes by just standing in front ofÂ  a special mirror.</li>
 	<li>A bathroom designed to help manage the elderly (for example) in terms of making sure they've been doing their bathroom routine and taking the appropriate medications. It then reports back to any caregivers to alert them of abnormalities.</li>
 	<li>An image search that allowed you to dynamically search for "simliar images". The system was smart enough to identify properties like number of people in the image, consistent colors, a positioning of objects in the frame.</li>
</ul>
I've included some of the photos I did manage to take. I should probably also do a quick shout out to the people that invented the massage chair with matching audio and light stimulation. I couldn't relax as well as I would have liked while testing their product because I kept thinking about how much I wanted to buy one...

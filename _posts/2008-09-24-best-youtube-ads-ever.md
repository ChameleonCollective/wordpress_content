I've seen two really first class uses of YouTube as a marketing tool recently and I thought you might enjoy seeing them as well. The first ad is for the new "Wario Land: Shake It" title on the Wii. The video which shows game play and the associated Wii hand motions also slowly starts to shake the entire YouTube page to pieces sending text and content flying. I've seen concepts like this before, but by being the first on YouTube it came on as totally unexpected which made it memorable and interesting.

The second ad for Samsung Instinct telephone. It uses some of the new functionality in YouTube to link between multiple videos. The series of videos are presented in a "Choose Your Own Adventure" style with amusing and racy content that is not only entertaining but demonstrates functionality on the phone successfully. Make sure you watch the video to the end to view the additional functionality.

My congrats to the agencies behind both ads. In fact if you see this blog post and you worked on one of these send me an email. I'd love to take you out for a drink in recognition of your original thinking.

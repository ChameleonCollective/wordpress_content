<img class="size-full wp-image-1416 alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Facebook Places Official Video" src="https://takemetoyourleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Facebook-Places-Official-Video.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="202" />Check out the official teaser video for Facebook places. What I really love about it is that it maps exactly to SapientNitro's PoV on the space-time continuum for experience mapping; in layman terms what we believe is that every moment should cross space and time. A moment crosses spacewhen multiple people in different locations can live the same moment .. for example,  you share a live video feed, lifecast, share status updates, photos, and your friends all over the world can interact with this content in real time. A moment crosses time when you can geo-tag content and you can interact with the same content any time in the future when you're in the same location ... or if your friends visit the same location, can could see your previous experiences in that place.<!--more-->

Everything we do, we do with a mindset of digital amplification through space and time ... and Facebook places is just, exactly, that. This can really be huge.

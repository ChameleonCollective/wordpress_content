The ad campaign will star comedian Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Gates, and it was developed to combat the negative image that many consumers have about Windows Vista and also to finally push back against Appleâ€™s popular Mac vs. PC campaign. Really interesting move by CPB, which after winning Microsoft back earlier this year finally shows the big idea.

It reminds me of a famous Steve Jobs quote on Microsoft: "The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste."

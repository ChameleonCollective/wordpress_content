I found this great post on innovation by <a title="Preparing for 2010 – Innovation Proverbs" href="https://blogs.gartner.com/carol_rozwell/2009/12/29/preparing-for-2010-innovation-proverbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carol Rozwell</a> -- a Gartner analyst I am meeting -- while I was reading her recent work... and since I will be posting a lot on the topic of innovation, thought it would be great to share this.

Innovation Proverbs by Joyce Wycoff
<ol>
 	<li>PEOPLE do innovation.</li>
 	<li>Innovation means doing something that hasn’t been done before.
By definition there is risk involved.
No risk; no innovation.</li>
 	<li>Innovation is a win-win process.
It creates new value for the customer and the organization.</li>
 	<li>Innovation is a team sport.
Teams are built around a common objective and trust.</li>
 	<li>Innovation requires risk.
Risk-taking requires trust.
Trust requires honesty and openness.</li>
 	<li>Innovation requires energy.
Energy comes from challenges that excite the imagination.</li>
 	<li>Innovation is about creating the future.
Cost-cutting and downsizing are about fixing the past.</li>
 	<li>Innovation is not just a rah-rah word or fad.
It is an investment in the future that requires new processes, time, energy, commitment and resources.</li>
 	<li>Innovation requires new information — from co-workers, customers, suppliers, competitors and from the world.</li>
 	<li>Innovation requires time — time to think, time to tinker, time to talk about possibilities and ideas.
Down-to-the-second controls can kill innovation.</li>
</ol>

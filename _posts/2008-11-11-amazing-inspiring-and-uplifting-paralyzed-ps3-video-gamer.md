I stumbled across an incredible story today on the <a href="https://boardsus.playstation.com/playstation/board/message?board.id=ps3&amp;amp;thread.id=3460820&amp;amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playstation gamer message boards</a>. A young paralyzed teen had an idea for how to build a rig that would allow him to play video games. The teen worked with Mark Felling who did the physical assembly of the gear and after a couple months they had a kit that allowed the boy to use the vast majority of the controls on a PS3. <!--more-->

In his own words:
<blockquote>"The main reason I put this on the PlayStation website was to show people that even the most limited person can still enjoy console gaming just as much... anyone else. the controller was pretty easy to make except for converting the analog signals into digital signals for when I use the various switches. this took about two months to build and get working effectively. here are a couple more pictures. this time much smaller,lol.I really want the Sony people to see this as well, because many years ago when I was asking about this they had no idea worked to send me.also I can see my television clearly with no instruction whatsoever even though it really works like I would not be able to see anything at all. if anybody knows anybody who could use assistance playing video games please let me know

Also each and every jack has a predetermined function and whichever one I plug into is what's the switch becomes. so depending on the game I generally use the left analog joystick directions and the right analog joystick using my tongue. currently I can d 20/25 possible functions all by myself. I'm currently using 16 switches plus a joystick with my tongue. saving up money to purchase three switches that are activated by the torching of a muscle. once I have those three switches I will just have to have somebody take care of something like select which is almost never used."</blockquote>
Ultimately this is about a teen who didn't let his disabilities hold him back.Â  He was able to do something that most of the kids his age were doing everyday. I'm sure on some deeply fundamental level that isn't obvious to all of us this one act allowed him to feel normal for just one moment.

He's missing a few parts to help complete his rig. I'd love to help him in someway. Does anyone know anyone at Microsoft or Sony that we might be able to pass this story on to and see if we can get him some more gear and games?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this story, but if nothing else I hope it brightens your day. It made my day.
